                            I built this Quiz app by going through the FREE Udemy course titled "Build a Quiz App with 
                            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript", making some small modifications along the way. The course 
                            offers a lot of great resources for learning how to build web apps. The project uses the 
                            Open Trivia DB api library.

                            Balloon Escape is a fun, friendly word guessing game. Incorrect guesses will cause the balloons to 
                            float away (once completed)! The game uses a list of U.S. cities as words to guess.
