        <h2>Welcome to my corner of the web</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve been developing software for over 15 years — from enterprise .NET applications to side projects that scratch a creative  
          itch.  I’m all about clean code, practical solutions, and learning something new every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is a mix of who I am: developer, church tech lead, grandparent on the go, and someone who still gets excited by  
          figuring out why a button isn’t working (and making it work better).

        <h2>What I’ve been building lately</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>KaelinFamily.com</strong> – A personal site where I share my passions: fitness, food, family, and full stack dev. 
            It’s a place for me to document my journey, share what I’m learning, and connect with others who have similar interests.
            Currently a mix of WordPress and some custom HTML/CSS, but I’m hoping to rebuild it with a more modern stack by the enhanced
            of August.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CLKComputing.com</strong> – This is my small business site where I offer web development services and tech consulting. 
            It is a simple one page site that I built reflect my straightforward, solutions-first approach. It's clean, fast, and highlights 
            the real value I bring to clients — whether they need a full-stack app, a smarter workflow, or just some honest tech advice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Church Live Stream System</strong> – I designed and manage the live stream setup for our church, using OBS, YouTube, and  
            and custom hardware.  It's become a key part of how we connect with folks who can’t attend in person.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GitHub Projects</strong> - <a href="./projects.html">Projects List</a> - This page features a dynamic list of my five most recently updated projects. 
            It fetches live data from the GitHub API using a fetch call and updates the HTML automatically—so the content 
            is always current.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="skills">
        <h2>Stuff I know well (and love using)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Languages:</strong> C#, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS, dabbling in Python  
          <br>
          <strong>Frameworks & Tools:</strong> ASP.NET, Git, SQL Server, Visual Studio, OBS, VS Code  
          <br>
          <strong>Other strengths:</strong> Bbreaking down complex tech for non-tech audiences, 
          solving real-world challenges, and maintaining composure under pressure—skills sharpened 
          during my military service.
