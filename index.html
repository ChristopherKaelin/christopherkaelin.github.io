      <h2>Welcome to my corner of the web</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve been developing software for over 15 years — from enterprise .NET applications to side projects that scratch a creative itch. I’m all about clean code, practical solutions, and learning something new every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is a mix of who I am: developer, church tech lead, grandparent on the go, and someone who still gets excited by figuring out why a button isn’t working (and making it work better).

      <h2>What I’ve been building lately</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Church Live Stream System</strong> – I designed and manage the live stream setup for our church, using OBS, YouTube, and custom hardware. It's become a key part of how we connect with folks who can’t attend in person.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>KaelinFamily.com</strong> – A personal site where I share my passions: fitness, food, family, and full stack dev. (Yes, I made this site too.)
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>CLKComputing.com</strong> – This is my small business site where I offer web development services and tech consulting. I built it from the ground up to reflect my straightforward, solutions-first approach. It's clean, fast, and highlights the real value I bring to clients — whether they need a full-stack app, a smarter workflow, or just some honest tech advice.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="skills">
      <h2>Stuff I know well (and love using)</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Languages:</strong> C#, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS, dabbling in Python  
        <br>
        <strong>Frameworks & Tools:</strong> ASP.NET, Git, SQL Server, Visual Studio, OBS, VS Code  
        <br>
        <strong>Other strengths:</strong> explaining tech to non-tech folks, solving real problems, and keeping cool under pressure
